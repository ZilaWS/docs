# Local events
Things happen all the time server side. They can be tracked, with `EventListener`s.

## Registering an EventListener
The first parametes is the event's name, the second is it's callback function. You don't have to worry about registering a function with wrong parameters. All of them are staticly typed.
```ts
client.addEventListener("onStatusChange", (newStauts: WSStatus) => {
    console.log(newStauts); //Enum
});
```

<OR />

This will only get executed once.
```ts
client.onceEventListener("onStatusChange", (newStauts: WSStatus) => {
    console.log(newStauts); //Enum
});
```
