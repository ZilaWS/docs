# Configuring the server

### Setting the port
```ts
port: number;
```
### Securing the connection
* Set this if you want to secure the connection
  ```ts
  https?: { ... }
  ```
    * The path to the certificate file. Supports: .pem

    ```ts
        pathToCert: string;
    ```

    * The path to the certificate key file. Supports: .pem
    ```ts
        pathToKey: string;
    ```
    * The password which the certificate is encrypted with.
    ```ts
        passphrase?: string;
    ```

### Verbose logging

```ts
verbose?: boolean;
```

### Logger
* You can override the server's default *Logger* system by giving this property an [ILogger](./ilogger) interface. 
* If you set it true, the default logging script will be used.

```ts
logger?: boolean | ILogger;
```

### Host
* Sets the host for the server
```ts
host?: string;
```

### Header event
* This event handler gets called before a new WS connection would be created.
* If you want to add new headers to the upgrade frame's reponse, return them as an array.

```ts
headerEvent?: (recievedHeaders: IncomingHttpHeaders) => Array<string> | void;
```

### Max waiter time
* The maximal waiting time for waiters.
* Defaults to 800ms

```ts
maxWaiterTime?: number;
```

### Custom client class

* More info [here](./extending)

```ts
clientClass?: new (
    socket: WebSocketClient,
    ip: string | undefined,
    server: ZilaServer,
    isBrowser: boolean,
    headers: { [name: string]: string },
    cookies?: Map<string, string>
) => ZilaClient;
```
