# Terminating a connection
There are two ways a connection can be terminated using *ZilaWS*.

## Kicking

Kicking a client only disconnects it from the server.

```ts
server.kickClient(clientSocket, "A reason to kick a client");
```

<OR />

```ts
clientSocket.kick("A reason to kick a client");
```

## Banning

Banning a client will blacklist it's IP-address from connecting again to the server. The list of banned clients refreshes with every server restart.

```ts
server.banClient(clientSocket, "A reason to ban a client");
```

<OR />

```ts
clientSocket.ban("A reason to ban a client");
```

## The client's perspective
The error handler gets called upon connection closing.

```ts
const client = await connectTo("wss://yourhost.com:6589", (reason?: string) => {
    //The reason param's value is going to be the reason of the kick or the ban.
});
```
