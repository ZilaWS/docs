# Stopping the server

## Asynchronous (recommended)

Using the async server stop method is more recommended because it will disconnect all of the clients safely.
You can even give it a reason which'll get sent down to all the clients. Of course, it is optional. 

```ts
await server.stopServerAsync("Server stop reason");
```

## Synchronous

```ts
server.stopServer();
```
