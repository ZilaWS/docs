# Stopping the server

## Asynchronous (recommended)

Using the async server stop method is recommended since it will disconnect all of the clients
safely. You are able to give a reason which will be sent down to the clients.
Naturally, it is optional.

```ts
await server.stopServerAsync("Server stop reason");
```

## Synchronous

```ts
server.stopServer();
```
