# Local events
Things happen all the time not just on the server side. They can be tracked, with `EventListener`s.

## Registering an EventListener
The first parametes is the event's name, the second is it's callback function. You don't have to worry about registering a function with wrong parameters. All of them are staticly typed.
```ts
client.addEventListener("onStatusChange", (newStauts: WSStatus) =>{
    console.log(newStauts); //Enum
});
```

<OR />

This will only get executed once.
```ts
client.onceEventListener("onStatusChange", (newStauts: WSStatus) => {
    console.log(newStauts); //Enum
});
```


## Currently available event types

- onStatusChange
  - Runs when the connection status changes
- onMessageRecieved
  - Runs after the client processes a newly recieved message
- onRawMessageRecieved
  - Runs before the client processes a newly recieved message
- onCookieSet
  - Runs when the server sends down one or multiple new cookies.
- onCookieDelete
  - Runs when the server deletes a cookie
